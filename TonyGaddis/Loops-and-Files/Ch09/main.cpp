    9. The Collatz Conjecture
        Write a program that lets the user enter a positive integer and then reduces that value
        to 1 by performing the following steps:
            • If the value of n is even, continue with n/2.
            • If n is odd, continue with 3n + 1.

        Display the intermediate steps and finally display the number of steps needed to reach 1.
        Input Validation: Make sure that the number entered is greater than 0.
