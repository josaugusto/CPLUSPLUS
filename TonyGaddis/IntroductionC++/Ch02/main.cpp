    2. The Golden Ratio
        The golden ratio is a ratio that appears in nature and produces pleasing, harmonious
        proportions. For rectangles, if the width is approximately 1.62 times the height, they
        will be in this ratio. Write a program that calculates the appropriate width for a rectangle
        with height 5 cm so that it fulfills this ratio.
